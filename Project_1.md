## Logic and Steps
1st step

```[22,27,16,2,18,6]``` 

2nd step

```[2,27,16,22,18,6]```

3rd step

```[2,6,16,22,18,27]```

4th step

```[2,6,16,18,22,27]```


## Big-O Notation 
```n + (n-1) + ... + 1 = (n^2 + n) / 2 -> O(n^2)```


## Time Complexity 

```For "2" -> Best Case O(1)```

```For "18" -> Avarage Case O(n^2)```

```For "27" -> Worst Case O(n^2)```
